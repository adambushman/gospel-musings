    "text": "After a year of studying the Old Testament and with the Christmas season upon us, thoughts naturally gravitate toward Jesus Christ. It’s common to review one’s relationship with the Savior and learn more of Him.\nMy personal thoughts have been draw to the common depictions of the Savior since the Renaissance. We’ve seen innumerable artistic depictions of The Son of God and countless oral and written narratives that have influenced society’s perception of His earthly life.\nDespite having a solid understanding of his humble birth, meager upbringing, controversial ministry, and bitter suffering, the aforementioned depictions of Christ have figuratively painted a picture in all our minds of a man, ruggedly handsome, white, large in stature, beloved by true believers, and merely misunderstood by skeptics.\n\n\n\nTraditional Christ\n\n\nThe more I learn, the less I resonate with these depictions. In fact, this past year has emboldened my suspicions that these creative liberties distract and confuse.\nIt’s my intent to explore Christ’s foreordination, the landscape of ancient Israel, the details of Jesus’ life on earth, and the encounters with His resurrected self to challenge our misconceptions in order to unlock a deeper power in his example and instruct about discipleship in modern day."

    "text": "Old Testament Types & Symbols\nThe Old Testament is a history of ancient people of the Holy Land, a record of its prophets’ communication with Jehovah, and the foretelling of the Messiah’s future visit to Earth to liberate His people and destroy their oppressors.\nOften these themes intertwine but at their core these are the messages ingrained into every “believer” of ancient times. Every scripture hero, every story, and every tradition pointed to that eventual day.\n\n\n\nProphets Ushering in the Messiah’s Coming\n\n\n\nFrom Adam & Eve sprung the life of mankind, just as their God would spring life everlasting\nSodom & Gamora were destroyed for their wickedness, but not before securing the righteous, just as was prophesied for the day of The Lord\nMoses brought the destruction of the Lord to liberate His people of the Egyptians, just as God would liberate again at His coming\nDavid conquered the giant Goliath, just as the mighty kingdoms of earth would crumble before their God\nElijah rained fire on the wicked priests and soldiers, just as was prophesied for The Lord’s coming\n\nThe prophet Isaiah foretold of the coming Messiah often and in great detail. In fact, he specifically cited the government (of which the Israelites knew many in their history), how the Lord would assume His role of ruler and thereby expelling whatever worldly force occupied His lands.\n\n\n\nFor unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\n\n\nOld Testament | Isaiah 9:6\n\n\n\nIn subsequent chapters, Isaiah would continue to make mention of the impending visit of the Lord while using language consistent with the destruction of the wicked and the lifting up of the righteous.\n“Burn”, “devour”, “consume”, “[hew] down”, “cut down”, etc., are all words and phrases used by Isaiah to describe the great and terrible day of the Lord.\n“Burden taken away”, “yoke destroyed”, “stay upon the Lord”, etc., Isaiah mentions to illustrate the salvation and restoration God would bring His chosen people.\nTo modern day Christians, these explicit prophecies make perfect sense thanks to the New Testament, The Book of Mormon, and the benefit of 2,000+ years of historical hindsight. However, less explicit declarations abound in the Old Testament and even today we struggle to put two and two together.\nNow place yourself some decades before the Meridian of Time with only the above prophecies, scriptural heroes, and the mounting “interpretation of men” to provide a lens through which to await the Messiah."

    "text": "Landscape before Christ’s Time\nThe latter half of the Old Testament details the line of Judah working to settle into the Holy Land in and around Jerusalem. Their ancestors occupied the region in the early days and returned from captivity in Egypt only to find their inherited land occupied by disbelievers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssyrian Empire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBabylonian Empire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersian Empire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreek Empire\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most all of history, Israel was a highly coveted region. It was the connective tissue between Europe and Africa. With the Mediterranean Sea to the West and the Syrian Desert to the East, trade and travel from all around was forced through Israel like a funnel.\nNaturally, the rise and fall of the world’s empires all occupied a common region at some point: Israel. Out of the pan in Egypt and into the fire of the Holy Land, so to speak. From Babylon to Persia, Assyria to Greece, the land was rarely theirs and theirs alone.\nMuch as the Lamanites to the Nephites of The Book of Mormon, the surrounding nations served to hasten the Lord’s people to repentance when they strayed from His word.\n\n\n\nAnd inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.\nAnd inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord…\nAnd if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.\n\n\nThe Book of Mormon | 1 Nephi 2:20-24\n\n\n\nCan we not begin to narrative frame these prophecies and stories?\nWhilst continually being oppressed by neighboring nations and seeing the destruction of their holy temple, all the while being told they were the Lord’s chosen people and hearing these promises of liberation, the Jews couldn’t help but anticipate and look for Jehovah’s grand visit.\nAs the years approached the coming of Christ even further, more prophets shared messages detailing this visit. Incidentally, the vague nature of these words further confused what to look for:\n\n\n\nGod is jealous, and the Lord revengeth; the Lord revengeth, and is furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.\nThe Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked:\nO Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.\n\n\nOld Testament | Nahum 1:2-3, 15\n\n\n\nHaving a record of Christ’s first visit, much of Christianity interprets these prophecies as detailing the Second Coming. But in X number of years before Christ, why would the Jews have thought that?\nPut yourself in their place and formulate a mental picture of the Lord as they would have interpreted. They were awaiting a military general with superhero powers.\n\n\n\nJehovah\n\n\nThink of the super heroes in our day. They are all modern facsimiles of old Roman, Greek, and Egyptian gods which themselves derived from pagan interpretations of God Almighty Himself.\n\n\n\nThor\n\n\nThey likely imagined the Messiah as Thor; big, strong, powerful, and imposing; a warrior and a ruler, coming in light and magnificence, demonstrating his power and majesty to the entire world.\nThis is the paradigm through which the Israelites awaited the Messiah. This is what they looked and prayed for. Can you blame them?"

    "text": "Landscape During Christ’s Time\nNot unlike the hundreds of years leading up to the meridian of time, the Holy Land once again fell under rule of a neighboring nation. This time the Romans, some 64 years BC, conquered Jerusalem and occupied the surrounding land.\nJames E. Talmage described the sentiment percolating the time:\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, the Jews took not kindly to alien domination, though for many generations they had been trained in that experience, their reduced status having ranged from nominal vassalage to servile bondage.\n\n\nJesus the Christ | Chapter 6\n\n\n\nMore than ever the need for the Lord’s reign was dire. The land was suffering through an apostasy where no prophet was called to instruct and prepare.\nInstead, the Jews leaned into their traditions and interpretations of the law. So arose the Pharisees and Sadducees, mixing political agendas with strict adherance to the letter of the law.\nWith this hyper focus, surely the senses were heightened and the eyes peeled evermore for the Lord’s coming. The stage was set and the people ready.\nClearly that’s why the time was chosen for Christ’s earthly mission. The details of the mission, to first provide spiritual salvation, proved inconsistent with expectations."

    "section": "Challenging the Narratives",
    "text": "Challenging the Narratives\nWe make much of Christ’s humble beginning, especially when celebrating His birth. Indeed He was born in circumstances befitting a man who’d experience the worst a fallen world had to offer.\nJesus found himself greeting the world away from His earthly parents’ home as they traveled to the land of their lineage. Due likely to the inconveniences of a small town swelling with an increase of visitors, the young family sought refuge in a stable where the baby Jesus would lie in a manger.\n\n\n\nThe Child Child is Born\n\n\nSigns abounded to announce the Savior’s birth but resembled not the grandeur anticipated by the Jews. No crowds or military hosts greeted their fearless leader. He was not bathed in riches or crowns that night.\nIn most all respects imaginable, Christ came to earth as quietly and destitute as any.\nJesus’ childhood and development is largely a mystery, save a few passages toward the end of Luke 2:\n\n\n\nAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him…\nThe child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it…\nAnd it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors and they were hearing him and asking him questions.\nAnd all that heard him were astonished as his understanding and answers.\n\n\nOld Testament | Juke 2: 40, 43, 46-47 (Joseph Smith Translation)\n\n\n\nCertainly Jesus, even as a young man, was physically capable and highly developed intellectually. However, it’s unlikely that the elite of the day hadn’t seen child prodigies or at minimum saw to rigorous education of fortunate youth.\nIt wasn’t Christ’s years that surprised them alone. There must have been other components that made this particular boy so unlikely to possess such wisdom and communication skills.\nWe now have the first bit of first hand evidence for what Christ mission was foreordained to be.\n\nReally a Carpenter?\nTake Jesus’ trade: carpenter. While certainly not a glamorous profession, Christianity has embraced the endearing, romantic notion of a carpenter.\nConsider a common depiction of young Jesus alongside Joseph in a quaint workshop. A dose of historical reality frames this narrative differently.\n\n\n\nCarpenter Narrative\n\n\nCarpenter, or tekton in Hebrew, refers to a builder of various materials. Was wood the material of choice in barren Nazareth or would stone have been more common? Discipleship and Ethics explores the topic more in a June 2022 post, adding to the idea that Christ was more of a construction worker than the English translation leads us to believe.\nChristian Professor Jordan Monson of Northwestern University further summarizes the profession in saying, “Jesus was not elite. His trade was not respected” (Christianity Today).\nJesus and his earthly father figure Joseph were laborers, subject to demanding, dangerous work befit for those with no alternative.\n\n\nNazareth\nWhen Christ began his mortal ministry, calling disciples and beginning to teach, the Apostle Phillip invited Nathaniel to come and see Jesus of Nazareth. Nathaniel’s response reveals the common perception of Jesus’ homeland: “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” (John 1:46).\n\n\n\nNazareth\n\n\nIn our day, he’d have been the trailer park kid, from the other side of the train tracks. He’d have been the kid others picked on and avoided being around. As an adult, he’d have been profiled and defined purely based on his environment.\nThis shouldn’t come as a surprise. Isaiah put it very plainly:\n\n\n\nHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief…he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n\n\nOld Testament | Isaiah 53:3\n\n\n\nYou don’t become “acquainted with grief” from 24 hours of suffering in Gethsemane and on Calvary. No, He was familiar with prejudice and cruelty all His life and it likely wasn’t just because He was poor.\n\n\nNo Form Nor Comliness\nAs commonplace as physical disabilities and deformities are in our society today, consider the increased frequency that accompanied ancient times without modern medicine and the conveniences of daily life tha afforded safety and security.\nIt’s my belief that Jesus lived with a deformity or psychical attribute that prompted the prophet Isaiah to describe Him in such brutally descriptive a summary as this:\n\n\n\nFor he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him…\nAnd we hid as it were our faces from him;\n\n\nOld Testament | Isaiah 53:2-3\n\n\n\nDid the incarnate Christ have rotten or missing teeth? A clef palette? Were his features disproportionate? Did he have a skin condition? Did he have an awkward gait? Was he too tall or too short, too thick or too thin?\nForget the chiseled mountain man or the comely white prince. Christ was an ancient Jew of Palestine. He had black hair, brown eyes, and olive skin. By all accounts, He was, in crass terms, ugly and forgettable.\nConsider the below images generated via Artificial Intelligence (AI) using prompts similar to the words of Isaiah. Perhaps these paint a more realistic depiction of Christ:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI #4\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Christ’s foreordained mission, Old Testament symbols, prophetic descriptions, disciple accounts, and modern day research, ask yourself: which more closely depicts our earthly Savior?\nWhite, handsome and inviting or dark, ragged and avoidable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI #5\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted, these perspectives challenge the narrative society has conditioned us to. But consider accounts from the New Testament through this lens:\n\nSermon on the Mount\nThe first public ministry on record in Matthew is the Sermon on the Mount. He begins in chapter 5 speaking of “the poor in spirit”, “they that mourn”, “the meek”, “they that hunger and search after righteousness”, “the merciful”, “the pure in heart”, “the peacemakers”, and “they which are persecuted for righteousness”.\nThese He calls “Blessed”.\nThat’d be mighty insulting and arrogant coming from someone popular, well put together, and respected. But from someone who visually fits these categories? Talk about powerful.\n\n\nHealing the Leper\nFew maladies were as panic inducing to the general populace than leprosy. Generally thought of as a disease of the unclean, this disease crippled, paralyzed, and left afflicted with serious sores and legions.\nTraditional social circles casted these out, leaving them to struggle for life and meaning with others so less fortunate. From an isolated community such as this came a leper unto Jesus asking to be made clean (Matthew 8).\nChrist performed an array of miracles to mend the broken body. The blind man, the cripple, the dead, and the sick. Most every time they sought Him out. They would leave the normalcy of their isolated life to bear the scorn and rage of the “whole” who cared not for their presence.\nSure, the reputation for healing certainly emboldened the afflicted to come but what incentivized the first few to trust Jesus? Perhaps because He was like them, in more ways than one.\n\n\nEating with the Sinners\nChrist was approached by “publicans and sinners” who sat to eat with Him and His disciples. Why would societal castoffs cling to Jesus (Matthew 9)?\nThe Pharisee’s must have seen it as a way to discredit the Savior’s self-claimed lineage and mission, thus asking His disciples, “Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?” No doubt they were hoping for Christ to describe more of His humble upbringing.\nInstead, Christ’s answer emphasized His role as a spiritual physician to everyone that would receive Him (Joseph Smith’s Translation emphasizes this message).\n\n\n\nCrucifixion of Christ\n\n\n\n\nCrucified\nWe know Christ’s final hours well, including the suffering to which He was subject leading up to and including His being lifted upon a cross.\nChrist was flanked by thieves at the time of His passing (Matthew 27). Even they mocked Him, along with the priests who orchestrated the night’s passing of judgement. In His worst moments, He was challenged for His beliefs and ridiculed for His stance.\nHe was tempted one final time to exercise His divine power for Himself, just as Satan had done to begin His ministry (Matthew 4). Herein did Christ inspire even the Roman soldiers with His resolve to all He had preached.\nChrist’s life demonstrated that a fallen world and other’s actions may ruin our mortal experience. We may be brought suffering of all sorts due to no fault of our own. But the story doesn’t stop there.\nIt is how Christ overcame such atrocities that supplies the power to transform the situations we find ourselves in."
